youth

it is not a matter of rosy cheeks,red lips and supple knees;it is a matter of the will,a quality of the imagination,a vigor of the emotions;it is the freshness of the deep springs of life.

of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease.

This often exists in a man of 60 more than a boy of 20.Nobody grows old merely by a number of years. We grow old by diserting our ideals.
