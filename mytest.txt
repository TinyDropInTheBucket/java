youth

it is not a matter of rosy cheeks,red lips and supple knees;it is a matter of the will,a quality of the imagination,a vigor of the emotions;it is the freshness of the deep springs of life.


Youth means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity,of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease.
